FPGA can be programmed with Openocd (http://openocd.org/). Scripts for programming the FPGA and SPI flash are in the "openocd" folder. Copy the bit file to openocd folder and use the command "openocd -f <script.cfg>" to program the board.

Before communication is possible with the board through USB, FT2232D EEPROM needs to be programmed. Port B needs to be changed in FIFO 245 mode. This can be done using FTDIs "ft-prog" tool.
