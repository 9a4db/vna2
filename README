FPGA can be programmed with the Papilio-prog tool: https://github.com/GadgetFactory/Papilio-Loader. A patch in "fpga/vna2.patch" needs to be applied for the tool to be able to program Artix-7.

Before communication is possible with the board through USB, FT2232D EEPROM needs to be programmed. Port B needs to be changed in FIFO 245 mode. This can be done using FTDIs "ft-prog" tool.
